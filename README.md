# JS-Class
A website for JS Fun class.

## Contributing
To start contributing for the repo and run these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-name>/js-class.git
cd js-class
npm install
```

After running those commmands you will have cloned the repo to your local machine. Then changed into the project directory and installed all the node modules the project uses.

The next step is to install `nodemon` on your machine. First, check to see if it's already installed by typing `nodemon -v` into your terminal and pressing enter. If you get a version number as a response then you can move onto the next step. If you get a response saying that `nodemon` is not a recognized command then run `npm install -g nodemon`. After that, the next step is to start `nodemon` by typing `nodemon` in your terminal/commmand line.
